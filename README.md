This project challenges developer to build a classic Flappy Bird game using modern web development technologies. Here's the breakdown:

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand the core concepts of React component structure and state management.
- Utilize TypeScript for type safety and improved code maintainability.
- Integrate HTML and CSS for rendering game elements and styling.
- Implement game mechanics like gravity, jumping, collision detection, and scoring.

### Project Requirements:
- **Development Environment:** Setup a development environment with Node.js, npm (or yarn), and a code editor like Visual Studio Code.
- **Project Structure:** Organize the project with separate folders for components, styles, assets (images/sounds), and a main App.tsx file.
- **Game Components:** Create React components for the bird, ground, pipes, and a background.
- **State Management:** Use React state to manage the game state (playing, game over), bird position, score, and pipe generation.
- **User Input:** Implement event listeners to handle user input (e.g., spacebar press) for making the bird jump.
Game Loop: Utilize the useEffect hook or a library like react-loop to create a game loop for continuous animation and updates.
- **Game Mechanics:**
    1. Implement gravity that pulls the bird downwards.
    2. Handle bird jumps with a limited upward movement.
    3. Generate random pipes (top and bottom) at regular intervals with varying gaps.
    4. Move pipes horizontally across the screen at a constant speed.
    5. Detect collisions between the bird and the ground, pipes, or the top of the screen.
    6. Update the score based on successfully passing between pipes.
- **Styling:** Use CSS to style the game elements like background, bird, pipes, ground, and score display.
- **Optional Enhancements:**
    1. Implement a game over screen with score display and a restart button.
    2. Add sound effects for jumping and collisions.
    3. Improve visuals with animations for the bird and background.
